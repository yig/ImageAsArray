ImageAsArray.java:
    A java file with helpful (static) functions for loading and saving
    images in Java and accessing the image data as an array.
    Because Java does not have an 'unsigned byte' type, the code converts each
    pixel into four int's (alpha, red, green, blue), rather than bytes.
    See ImageAsArray.main() for a simple example that prints out the top-left
    pixel color as well as some image statistics (try it on red.png, green.png,
    and blue.png).

Convolve.java:
    A demo that applies a 3x3 convolution to an image.

tests:
    This directory contains a tiny Java-versus-C performance test (Java wins?!).
    It also contains a test file for some file-path parsing.
